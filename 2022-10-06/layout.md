# **Layout**
## *Normal flow*
If nothing touched, HTML elements will be arranged from top to bottom (block elements) and left to right (inline elements). It's called normal flow.   
Layout technique let us arrange HTML elements out of normal flow.

## *Float*
Block elements occupy all horizontal space even size of element is not that big.   
Float property limit occupation of an element only for its size and place it property value of its parent element. (left, right, top, bottom) So elements which have been under of it can be placed aside of it.   
Also it makes element literally floating like placed in another layer.
