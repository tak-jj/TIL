# **Hello World**
Stuffs here are record of daily study  
Each folder include
- topics I learned
- codes I copyed for practice
- tasks I done, sometimes glance samples  

All stuffs are written for review   
There can be time difference between folder date and written date   
Trying to use ENG but I'm not native   
It would be big help telling me weird point
