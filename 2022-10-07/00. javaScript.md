# **Start JavaScript**
## *Variable*
Computer is high-tech calculator.  
To calculate sth, need to memorize it. For us, usually write it on paper. For computer, save it somewhere in memory.   
Every memory space has its own address like 10011. To access and remember it easily, can name it. The name for memory address called 'Variable'.   
In other way, can understand variable as container for storing data.   

Can declare variable like
```js
let num
```
and store data in variable like
```js
num = 10
```
Can merge it like
```js
let num = 10
```
called initialization.

To call variable just type variable name like
```js
num
```

## *Datatype*
Belows are types of data can saved in var. Because operator operate differently depends on its datatype, should know which datatype saved in var.   
For example, use '+' to numbers it adds numbers but '+' to strings it place numbers side by side.
```js
let num = 1
let total = num + 10

let name = "park" + "jisung"
```

- ### number
    : int and float, just write number.

- ### string
    : series of text, should written in '' or "".

- ### boolean
    : True or False.

- ### array
    : kind of list, useful to handle multiple data with index.
    Written like ```['a', 'b', 'c']``` each data in array called element. Every elements have index number in order from 0.   
    Belows are some properties and methods handling array.
    ```js
    let array = ['a', 'b', 'c']
    array.push('d')
    /* add element to array */
    array.length
    /* count elements in array */
    array[0]
    /* call element in array by index */
    ```

- ### object
    : handle multiple data with key and value.   
    Written like ```{key1:value1, key2:value2}``` key and data in a group called element.   
    Belows are some properties and methods handling object.
    ```js
    let object = {"key1":"value1", "key2":"value2"}
    object["key3"] = "value3"
    /* add element key name 'key3' and value is 'value3' */
    object["key1"]
    /* call value whose key name is 'key1' */
    ```

- ### object in array
    : object can be element of array. Like
    ```js
    let people = [
        {'name':'kim', 'age':60},
        {'name':'lee', 'age':40}
    ]
    people.push({'name':'park', 'age': 30})
    /* add object element to array */
    people[0]['name']
    /* call 'name' value of first element in array */
    ```

---
## *Function*
Function is also a kind of datatype. Not basic calculation, want to set series of calculation repeatedly, use function.   
Function statement written
```js
function name(param){
/* declare name of function and list parameters used in function */
    param = (param * 2) / 13 
/* state operation want to execute using function */
    return param;
/* specify values want to return using function */
}
```

---
## *Conditional*
Use if statement can make conditional. Written
```js
if(condition1){
/* use boolean for condition */
    statement1
/* if condition1 is true, execute statement1 */ 
}else if(condition2){
/* if condition1 is false, check condition2 and proceed the same */
    statement2
}else {
/* if all condition is false, execute */
    statement3
}
```
For condition status can use   
'==(same)`, '!=(different)','>(bigger, smaller)', '>=(bigger or smaller and same)'   
'&&(and)', '||(or)'

---
## *Loop*
Use for statement can make loop. Written
```js
for(let i=0; i<100; i++){
    statement
/* put i=0 execute statement
and if second value is true,
execute third(i++ mean i = i+1)
and return to first */
}
```
For statement often use with array like
```js
for(let i=0; i<array.length; i++){
    console.log(array[0]);
}
```
